The Krakow **pIFJ** is a **PROTON IRRADIATION FACILITY at IFJ**. Our team can perform irradiations with an energy of protons up to 60 MeV. We have a wide range of beam intensity and various techniques of active and passive dosimetry. Parameters such as dose rate or proton beam flux are monitored on an ongoing basis during the experiment and recorded.  

Our infrastructure allows us to irradiate various types of samples:  
- biological (containing living cells),  - chemical - such as nanoparticles,  
- physical - testing the radiation hardness of materials or new detectors,  
- various types of electronics 
- including for the needs of the space industry.  

We invite our guests and clients to cooperate.
